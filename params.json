  "body": "# About Twitter4j-ads\r\n\r\nTwitter4j-ads is a stable and well tested Java SDK for Twitter's Ads API, originally developed and then open sourced by one of the top social media companies building upon the Ads API (Sprinklr). \r\n\r\nLearn more about obtaining Ads API access by visiting: https://dev.twitter.com/ads/overview\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that Gradle is installed and fork the Twitter4j-ads repo.\r\n2. Use the `build.gradle` file to create a project for Twitter4j-ads.\r\n3. Prepare the Consumer Key/Secret and Acess Token for your Ads API test application into appropriate place (see Authentication section for more information).\r\n4. Build project and test with test examples or a new main function.\r\n\r\n### SDK Structure and Design\r\n\r\nThe Twitter4j-ads Java SDK is built on top of design of Twitter4j to allow for easy integration with both Ads API and Organic (REST) API. Response objects are returned as iterable collections and SDK handles the work of paging with cursor for endpoints which support cursors.\r\n\r\n### Gradle\r\n\r\nWe recommend using Gradle to build and manage your project using Twitter4j-ads. The included `build.gradle` file includes dependency information for quickly getting up and running.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- JDK 1.7\r\n- Twitter4j 4.0.4 (org.twitter4j)\r\n- com.google.guava\r\n- com.google.http-client\r\n- com.google.api-client\r\n- com.google.code.gson\r\n- com.google.common.base.Optional\r\n- joda-time\r\n- commons-collections\r\n- org.apache.commons\r\n- junit\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nTwitter4j supports generally three methods of authentication: environment variables, configuration file, and via code functions. Configuration authentication through code is highly recommended to be able to store the access tokens in secure storage as well as scale the number of authentication tokens being used.\r\n\r\n##### Consumer Key/Secret\r\n\r\nStoring the consumer key and secret is how you authenticate your Ads API-approved App ID to access Twitter Ads API. Commonly this is stored in encrypted format in a place accessible by servers. Your Consumer Key/Secret for your Twitter Ads API application will come from http://apps.twitter.com.\r\n\r\n##### Access Tokens\r\n\r\nAccess tokens are OAuth 1.0A generated tokens to allow access on behalf of a user (advertiser) that has given permission to run campaigns on their behalf.\r\n\r\nYour implementation code will need to intelligently allow switching between different access tokens in order to provide functionality for more than one advertiser.\r\n\r\nPlease reference this Twitter Ads API documentation for more help in generating access tokens: https://dev.twitter.com/ads/overview/obtaining-ads-account-access\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\n* [Prashant Dubey](https://github.com/pradubey) (Sprinklr)\r\n* [Abhay Bansal](https://github.com/abhayb1988) (Sprinklr)\r\n* [Abhishek Anand](https://github.com/abhishekanand100) (Sprinklr)\r\n* [Akash Maurya](https://github.com/akash300) (Sprinklr)\r\n* [John Babich](https://github.com/jbabichjapan) (Twitter)\r\n* Manish Aggarwal (Sprinklr)\r\n* Nihit Purwar (Sprinklr)\r\n* Nikhil Kumar (Sprinklr)\r\n\r\n### LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
